    "For this work it was used publicly available data from LendingClub.com. It represents 9578 3-year loans that were funded through the LendingClub.com platform between May 2007 and February 2010. It's composed by 14 features, the target variable being \"not.fully.paid\". This variable indicates that the loan was not paid back in full (i.e., the borrower either defaulted or the loan was \"charged off,\" meaning the borrower was deemed unlikely to ever pay it back)."
